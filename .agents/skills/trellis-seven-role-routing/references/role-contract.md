# Trellis Seven-Role Contract

| Role | Default route | Trigger | Write boundary | Context | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| research | `exploration` | Missing repository or external evidence | Active task `research/` only | Native research context | Persisted source-indexed report |
| implement | `bounded_worker`; `hard_implementation` when classified hard | Reviewed implementation unit | Assigned paths | Implementation family | Artifacts and focused checks |
| check | `checking`; `hard_checking` after hard implementation | Implementation needs verification | Task scope; may self-fix | Check family | Findings and validation results |
| debug | `debugging` | Reproducible failure or failed prior fix | Assigned failure scope | Implementation family | Reproduction, root cause, regression proof |
| review | `review` | Independent judgment after checks | Read-only | Check family | Severity-ordered file:line findings |
| audit | `audit` | High-risk or cross-boundary traceability | Read-only | Check family | Requirement/risk/evidence trace |
| release | `release` | Release-readiness decision | Read-only | Check family plus operator evidence | `ready` or `blocked` only |

## Dispatch Contract

The main session must include:

1. `Active task: <task-path>` as the first line.
2. The exact role, model route, and bounded responsibility.
3. Repository-relative owned paths.
4. Dependencies that must complete first.
5. Expected artifacts.
6. Executable or inspectable proof.

Completion text is not proof. The main session verifies artifacts and commands
before integration. No child role may commit, push, merge, archive a task, or
spawn another Trellis role.

## Context Families

- Implementation family: `implement.jsonl`, every real referenced spec or
  research file, `prd.md`, optional `design.md`, optional `implement.md`.
- Check family: `check.jsonl`, every real referenced spec or research file,
  `prd.md`, optional `design.md`, optional `implement.md`.
- Custom roles read the exact task path from the dispatch prompt. If it is
  missing or invalid, they stop and ask the main session. They never guess or
  borrow another session's active task.

## Channel Adapter

Channel roles use `.trellis/agents/<role>.md` and are separate from platform
profiles. The main session supplies the active task plus explicit `--file` or
`--jsonl` context. Prefer direct Codex read-only roles when the filesystem
boundary must be enforced; Channel read-only cards are instruction boundaries.
