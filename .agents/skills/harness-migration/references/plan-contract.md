# Plan Contract

Run the source template runner with explicit roots:

```powershell
python "$template/.trellis/scripts/harness_migrate.py" plan --template $template --target $target --format json --output $plan
```

For a fresh target, add `--developer <name>`. Do not add `--developer` for an
existing Trellis target. A target with only `.codex/`, or with a malformed
`.trellis/` footprint, is `unsupported_partial`, not fresh. Treat the CLI's
`targetState` as authoritative and stop if it differs from the requested flow.
Planning is non-mutating apart from the explicitly requested plan file.
The `plan` command accepts optional `--profile <name>`. Omitting it selects the
manifest-owned `complete` profile. Use another profile only when its narrower
scope matches the reviewed migration request; unknown profile names are
rejected.

For the narrow direct-adoption flow, invoke the same normal planner with the
only permitted partial-state opt-in:

```powershell
python "$template/.trellis/scripts/harness_migrate.py" plan --template $template --target $target --profile complete --adopt-partial --format json --output $plan
```

This requires exactly `unsupported_partial`; it rejects fresh, existing,
unsafe, linked, non-Git, dirty, or session-active targets before backup or a
target write. `--profile complete` must be supplied explicitly for adoption,
even though an ordinary plan defaults to `complete`. It has no baseline
argument and never reads historical backups.

The JSON plan is an integrity-checked document. Its top-level fields are
`schemaVersion`, `templateVersion`, `templateRoot`, `targetRoot`,
`targetState`, `developer`, `manifestDigest`, `profile`, `actions`, `blockers`,
`conflicts`, `decisions`, `verificationCommands`, and `planDigest`. A schema-2
direct-adoption plan additionally has the required boolean `adoptPartial`.
Do not
hand-edit it: `resolve` validates and re-digests it. The selected `profile` is
part of `planDigest`, and `apply` rebuilds that same profile canonically before
any target write; `adoptPartial`, the partial input state, and `complete`
profile are included in that replay.

Each action has `path`, `kind`, `operation`, `reason`, `sourceDigest`,
`targetDigest`, `destination`, `destinationDigest`, and `decisionId`.
`destination`, `destinationDigest`, and `decisionId` are `null` when not
applicable. Valid kinds are `replaceable_managed`, `merge_required`,
`preserve`, `runtime_excluded`, `fresh_only_skeleton`, and `support_only`.
A sidecar destination is incoming content that requires a manual merge, not a
completed merge.

Each decision has `id`, `paths`, `reason`, `allowedChoices`, and `selection`.
Offer only the choices listed in that particular plan. Common choices have
these effects:

- `install`, `replace`, or `snapshot`: install incoming content; `snapshot`
  adopts the paired official `.trellis/.version` and template-hash baseline.
- `sidecar`: write incoming content as `<path>.harness-new`, preserving the
  target file for manual reconciliation.
- `keep`, `preserve`, or `skip`: retain target content or leave the incoming
  content uninstalled.

The official-baseline decision is paired: preserving the target baseline is
the conservative existing-project choice; selecting `snapshot` requires the
CLI's snapshot-parity validation. Security settings in `.codex/config.toml`,
existing hooks, target instructions, specs, and package configuration need a
user decision rather than a default migration choice.

Resolve only user-selected plan entries:

```powershell
python "$template/.trellis/scripts/harness_migrate.py" resolve --plan $plan --decision '<id>=<choice>' --output $resolvedPlan
```

Repeat `--decision` only for distinct IDs from that plan. Re-run planning if
the CLI reports a stale or invalid plan.

## Unsupported Partial Recovery

Recovery is a separate, baseline-bound transaction:

```powershell
python "$template/.trellis/scripts/harness_migrate.py" recover-plan --template $template --target $target --baseline $baseline --format json --output $recoveryPlan
python "$template/.trellis/scripts/harness_migrate.py" recover-resolve --plan $recoveryPlan --decision '<id>=<choice>' --output $resolvedRecoveryPlan
python "$template/.trellis/scripts/harness_migrate.py" recover-apply --plan $resolvedRecoveryPlan --approve --backup $recoveryBackup --format json
```

`recover-plan` accepts only the CLI-classified `unsupported_partial` state and
only an explicitly named direct `.trellis/.backup-*` directory. It validates
the baseline tree shape, version, `.trellis/.template-hashes.json` contents,
developer compatibility, and canonical containment. The closed recovery plan
fields are `schemaVersion`, `transactionType`, `templateVersion`,
`templateRoot`, `targetRoot`, `targetState`, `baselineRoot`,
`baselineVersion`, `baselineDigest`, `baselineAudit`,
`quarantinedTargetStates`, `manifestDigest`, `actions`, `blockers`, `conflicts`,
`decisions`, `verificationCommands`, and `planDigest`.

`baselineAudit.hashStatus` is `verified` with an empty `quarantinedPaths`
array when all recorded hashes match. An exact normalized mismatch whose
most-specific current complete-manifest rule is `merge_required` instead uses
`verified_with_quarantined_merge_required` and records the path, expected and
actual `sha256:` digests, `merge_required`, and fixed reason
`baseline_digest_mismatch_merge_required`. Every other mismatch blocks.
`quarantinedTargetStates` binds the same sorted path set with equal pre/post
digests (including `missing`). Both structures are closed and plan-digested.

Recovery considers only files present in both the baseline and current
manifest-owned `complete` export. It excludes support-only, runtime, preserve,
fresh-skeleton, project spec, task, workspace, developer, current-task, and
runtime paths. It also removes quarantined paths before building actions or
decisions, so their baseline bytes cannot be staged, sidecarred, journaled, or
restored. Existing collisions expose only `sidecar`, `keep`, and `replace`.
Apply canonically rebuilds the same recovery plan and audit, and proves each
quarantined live path still equals its recorded pre/post state before creating
an external backup or writing the target.

Use normal `verify --receipt ...` and separately authorized `rollback
--receipt ... --approve` with a recovery receipt. After successful recovery,
discard every pre-recovery normal plan and generate a fresh normal plan; the
recovery transaction does not authorize that plan or its apply. The recovery
receipt repeats `baselineAudit` and `quarantinedTargetStates`; verification
checks those actionless paths before and after commands. Rollback refuses a
changed quarantined target and never restores quarantined baseline bytes.
